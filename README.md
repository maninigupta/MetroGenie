 - new card: $2.50 x days_of_use x daily_uses = trip_fare; (trip_fare/1.05) + $1 = final_cost
 - existing: $2.50 x days_of_use x daily_uses = trip_fare; (trip_fare/1.05)      = final_cost

 *** If EXISTING CARD: ask if there's a balance. We'll need to subtract existing amount from the overall amount in "value" option.

METROCARD RULES: 
Use the same MetroCard over and over again because MetroCard is now more flexible than ever.

Here's how it works

Using a Pay-Per-Ride MetroCard? Now you can add Unlimited Rides to it.
Using an Unlimited Ride MetroCard? Now you can also add a dollar value to it.
Just bought an Unlimited Ride MetroCard and want to add more time to it? Just make sure you activate your Unlimited Ride MetroCard by using it at least once; then you can refill it.
Whether you choose to add time or value, just bring your MetroCard to any MetroCard Vending Machine or station booth to make your transaction.
The MTA charges a $1.00 "new card fee" for each new MetroCard purchased at a MetroCard Vending Machine or station booth, or commuter rail station.
Important things to Know

Time on your MetroCard will always be used first for paying your fare.
Value on your MetroCard will become available for use only when all time runs out on your card.  For example, if you have $7.00 in value remaining on your card and you decide to add a 7-day Unlimited Ride pass, the next time you use your card, it will activate the Unlimited rides, and the value will only become available to you when the 7-day time period expires.  Note:  On PATH, AirTrain and Express buses, a MetroCard with both time and value will deduct the value based portion of your card (as these services do not accept 7- and 30-Day Unlimited Ride MetroCard).
Your MetroCard can only hold one Unlimited Ride refill at a time. And remember, your refill is activated on the first swipe only after your current Unlimited Ride period ends. Once you’ve activated it again, you can refill it again.
Your MetroCard can be refilled with time and value for about one year. The MetroCard Vending Machine will tell you when the card expiration date is coming up, and will issue you a new MetroCard at no charge with all your purchases on it.
About the $1.00 New Card Fee

The MTA charges a $1.00 "new card fee" for each new MetroCard purchased at a MetroCard Vending Machine or station booth, or commuter rail station.
Avoid this fee by keeping and refilling your current MetroCard at any MVM or station booth.
You will be issued a new MetroCard at no charge if your card is expiring or damaged.
The new $1.00 charge will not apply to a MetroCard bought at an out-of-system vendor, reduced fare customers (seniors and customers with disabilities), users of EasyPayXpress cards, transit benefit organization customers who get their MetroCards directly from employers or their benefit providers, and customers who purchase a combination railroad/MetroCard ticket.
MTA produces nearly 160 million MetroCards each year at an annual cost of $10 million. Many of these cards are used once and then discarded, often ending up as litter in the system. By refilling and reusing your current MetroCard, you avoid the new $1.00 “new card fee,” reduce MTA expenses and help the environment.
